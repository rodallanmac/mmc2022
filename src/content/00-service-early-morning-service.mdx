The early Sunday morning Musgrave community gather together to worship, break bread and share in communion.
Warm greetings are given by the minister, hymns boot up to full pitch assisted by the generous volume of an ancient full-walled pipe organ.  

Then a time of greeting and passing the peace of Jesus. Readings, notices and prayers are offered by the 
society steward. Through his message the minister, David Barbour, shares the good news of Jesus Christ. 
Towards the end of this time honored early morning service the people move into a time of contemplation and intercessory prayer. 
Afterward all are welcomed to communion with the risen Lord â€“ Jesus Christ.
