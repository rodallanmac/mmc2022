At Musgrave all are welcome. The 09:15 family service has always been favoured by a broader community ranging from young families with children, couples, single folks, and importantly our older generation from the surrounding community. Unlike the 07:30 service, which is more traditional in nature, the 09:15 service kicks off with a call to worship, modern choruses and prayer.  

Thereafter the community passes the peace together. The Musgrave Kids along with their supervisors and teachers, move to the main church hall and gather into their different groups.  Readings, notices and prayers are done by the society steward, one or two hymns are sung supported by the generous volume of the pipe organ and then the minister's message is given. 

There are usually tea and eats offered after each service.

Communion is given, once a month, at the beginning of each month.
