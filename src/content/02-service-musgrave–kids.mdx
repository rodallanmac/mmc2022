#### All who gather at Musgrave are reminded of the words of Jesus.   

> Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.  
– Mathew 19:14-15

Everyone starts church together. The Musgrave Kids worship with the adults after which everyone passes the peace together. Then the Kids, with their supervisors and teachers, move to the main church hall and gather into their different groups. Here the Musgrave Kids experience a safe place for personal spiritual growth amongst a supportive community of friends.
