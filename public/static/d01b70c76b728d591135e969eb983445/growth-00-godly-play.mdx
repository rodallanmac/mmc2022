#### WHAT IS GODLY PLAY?  

Godly Play is hard to describe. It is hard to pin down. It is one of those things you have to experience to appreciate. Think of when you play — what is at its essence?  

With real play, we experience the deepest level of connectedness. We are fully present, alive and engaged. There is something immensely satisfying about being in play. 

Godly Play is about experiencing the stories of scripture with all the senses — hearing, sight, touch, consciousness, imagination and spirit. God is present, mysteriously pursuing us with an invitation to join the experience. 

Artistically crafted figurines, creatively handmade objects, illustrations, drawings and paintings on cards, symbols and banners are all used to build a visual tension. We can see people walking across the desert – there goes Abraham and Sarah – the good samaritan bends down to help – the robbers lurk close by – God comes close. 

Godly Play is the result of 40 years of research and practice by theologian, author and educator Rev. Dr. Jerome Berryman. Jerome studied theology at Princeton University and realised that something was missing from the curriculum – children.  Recognising that Jesus placed so much importance on children and their faith, Jerome spent the rest of his life developing and honing Godly Play as resource for children's spiritual growth.

The Godly Play method is a 3-4 year curriculum of spiritual practice exploring the mystery of God’s presence in our lives. In total there are about one hundred stories. 

Godly Play practice teaches us to listen for God and to make authentic and creative responses to God’s call in our lives. Godly Play is a creative, imaginative approach to Christian formation and spiritual guidance. 

Godly Play values process, openness, discovery, community and relationships. Godly Play models the worship life, stories, symbols and rituals of Christian congregations. Godly Play allows practitioners to make relevant and personal theological meaning. Godly Play nurtures participants to larger dimensions of belief and faith through wondering and play.

> You could hear a pin drop. There was an awkwardness in the room.  We were listening to the story of the 10 commandments and the giving of the law. The children were uncomfortable.  When they heard how Jesus came and fulfilled the law and gave us grace instead of condemnation – there were loud exclamations of appreciation, wonder and joy. I will never forget those smiles.
