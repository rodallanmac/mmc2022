**All who gather at Musgrave are reminded of the words of Jesus.**    

*Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.*  
â€“ Luke 18:17 

Everyone starts church together. The Musgrave Kids worship with the adults after which everyone passes the peace together. Then the Kids, with their supervisors and teachers, move to the main church hall and gather into their different groups. Here the Musgrave Kids experience a safe place for personal spiritual growth amongst a supportive community of friends.
